short-description: "A great place to start if you're interested in hacking."
full-description: >
  Some of you lot have never written a line of code, and others of you
  spend your weekends writing C for fun (you're insane).

  A coding event that suits everyone sounds impossible, right?
  Think again. We'll have pizzas, games and a CTF style coding challenge
  for everyone who wants to get involved.

  There'll be prizes for the quickest team to finish!
